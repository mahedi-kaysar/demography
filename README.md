# Demography
Demography is the statistical study of populations, especially human beings.
As a very general science, it can analyse any kind of dynamic living population,
i.e., one that changes over time or space (see population dynamics).
Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations,
and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to birth, migration, ageing, and death.
